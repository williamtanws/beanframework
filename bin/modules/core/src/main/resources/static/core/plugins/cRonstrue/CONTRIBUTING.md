Hello there ðŸ‘‹.  Are you interested in contributing to this project?  If so, it is appreciated!

Adding new i18n translations is always welcome. Referencing previously merged PRs ([like this one](https://github.com/bradymholt/cRonstrue/pull/106)) is a good way to learn what is needed to add a translation.

If you would like to make a non-trivial change to this project, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue so that it can be vetted first. Contributions are appreciated but there may be a case where a change would not align with the intended direction of the project and doing work on a PR and then not getting it merged is never fun.

Here are some helpful scripts that should help you get up and running:


### Setup

```
npm install
```

### Build
```
npm start
```

### Test

```
npm test
```
